Line Following Robot with ESP8266, 3 IR Sensors, and L293D Motor Driver
This repository contains the code and schematic for building a line-following robot using the ESP8266, 3 IR sensors, and the L293D motor driver. The robot is capable of following a line, making turns (up to 60 degrees), U-turns, and resuming path tracking even after a line break.

Features
Line following: The robot uses three IR sensors to detect the black line on a white surface.
Sharp turns and U-turns: Capable of making turns as sharp as 60 degrees and full U-turns.
Line break recovery: The robot can detect and resume the path after a line break.
Components
ESP8266 (NodeMCU): The microcontroller used to control the robot and read inputs from the sensors.
L293D Motor Driver: Drives the two DC motors based on the inputs from the ESP8266.
3 IR Sensors: Detect the black line by sensing the difference in reflection from the surface.
2 DC Motors: Drive the wheels of the robot to follow the line.
Circuit Diagram

Explanation of the Diagram:
ESP8266:
Pins D1, D2, and D3 are connected to the three IR sensors for reading their values.
Pins D5, D6, D7, and D8 are connected to the L293D motor driver to control the direction and speed of the motors.
IR Sensors:
The three IR sensors are placed at the front of the robot to detect the line.
Their signal pins are connected to D1, D2, and D3 of the ESP8266. They send a HIGH or LOW signal depending on whether the sensor detects the black line or the white surface.
L293D Motor Driver:
Controls two DC motors that drive the robotâ€™s wheels.
IN1 (D5) and IN2 (D6) control one motor, while IN3 (D7) and IN4 (D8) control the other motor.
The motor driver gets power from a 9V battery and sends power to the motors as directed by the ESP8266.
DC Motors:
Two DC motors power the wheels, enabling the robot to move forward, backward, and make turns.
Power Supply:
The ESP8266 is powered by a 5V supply.
The motors are powered by a 9V battery connected to the motor driver.
How It Works
The IR sensors detect the position of the black line on the ground. The ESP8266 reads the sensor values and sends signals to the L293D motor driver to adjust the motor speeds. This keeps the robot aligned with the line, and it adjusts its direction depending on which sensor is detecting the line.
